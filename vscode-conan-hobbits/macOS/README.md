# Developing Hobbits with Visual Studio Code, Conan, and Qt Creator (on MacOS)
Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a very popular and flexible text editor. This guide and accompanying config files should help you get set up developing hobbits with VSCode as your primary editor.

In the setup described here, Conan will be used to resolve dependencies, and Qt Creator will be used to edit Qt *.ui form files.

 - A modern C++ toolchain
 - CMake 3.12+
